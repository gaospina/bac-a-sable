/**
 * DEPECATED: the whole scheduling package is deprecated since OScaR 4.0 and will be fully reworked
 *  This package is a scheduling library.
 * it supports
 - [[oscar.cbls.business.scheduling.model.CumulativeResource]]
 - [[oscar.cbls.business.scheduling.model.Activity]] with varying durations and precedence constraints
 - [[oscar.cbls.business.scheduling.model.SuperActivity]] that align their start and end to other tasks.
 *   This is useful to model that a resource is not released between tasks.
 *
 * In this package, Tasks are grouped into [[oscar.cbls.business.scheduling.model.Planning]] that keeps references to all tasks and resources.
 * This package features the [[oscar.cbls.business.scheduling.solver.IFlatIRelax]] search heuristics with various tunings
